**Stress and Accent**

Words that end in a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) or the consonants n or s have their natural stress on the next to last syllable (cucaRAcha, TRIste, voLUmen, exAmen, toMAtes).

Words that end in any consonant other than n or s have their natural stress on the ﬁnal syllable (saLUD, paPEL,, vegeTAL, aZUL).

When a word does not follow one of these two rules, it will have a written accent on the syllable that is stressed (teléfono, lámpara, música).

If a one-syllable word has a written accent, it means that there is another word in the language that has the same spelling, but another meaning (el - the, él - he, si - if, sí - yes) .

If a two-syllable word has a written accent that does not affect the pronunciation, it means that there is another word that has the same spelling, but a
different meaning (e.g., este - this, éste - this one,  ese - that, ése - that one).

Interrogative words have an accent mark that does not affect pronunciation (¿qué? - what?, ¿quién? - who?, ¿dónde? - when?)

## Nouns, Articles, and Adjectives

**The Gender of Nouns and the Deﬁnite Article**

In Spanish, all nouns are either masculine or feminine. The deﬁnite article (English the) agrees with the noun in gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural): el, la, los, las.

The masculine singular noun takes the deﬁnite article el. Most nouns that end in -o are masculine (el amigo - the friend, el gato - the cat, el vino - the wine, el vestido - the dress)

Many masculine nouns do not end in -o (el animal - the animal, el hombre - the man) and some end in -a or -ma (el clima - the climate, el drama - the drama).

The feminine singular noun takes the deﬁnite article la. Most nouns that end in -a are feminine (la amiga - the friend, la blusa - the blouse, la case - the house, la tienda - the store).

Nouns that end in -ción, -sión, -dad, -tad, or -tud are feminine (la canción - the song, la ilusión - the illusion, la ciudad - the city, la actitud - the attitude).

A few nouns that end in -o are feminine (la foto - the photo).

A noun ending in -ista can be masculine or feminine, depending on whether it refers to a male or a female person (el artista, la artista - the artist). A noun ending in -nte can be masculine or feminine, depending on whether
it refers to a male or a female (el estudiante, la estudiante - the student)

A masculine noun that ends in a vowel adds -s to form the plural; it takes the deﬁnite article los (los libros - the books). If the noun ends in a consonant, el changes to los and the noun adds -es (los hoteles - the hotels).

A feminine noun that ends in a vowel adds -s to form the plural; it takes the deﬁnite article las (las ventanas - the windows). If the noun ends in a consonant, la changes to las and the noun adds -es (las flores - the flowers).

**The Indeﬁnite Article**

The Spanish singular indeﬁnite article (English a, an) is un before a masculine noun (un espejo - a mirror) and una before a feminine noun (e.g., una página - a page).

The Spanish plural indeﬁnite article (English some) is unos before a masculine plural noun (unos idiomas - some languages) and unas before a feminine plural noun (unas conversaciones - some conversations).

**Adjectives**

A Spanish adjective agrees in gender and number with the noun it modiﬁes. In Spanish, an adjective almost always follows the noun it describes.
